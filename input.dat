! Input file for linear monoisperse chains
! Line by line escription of input:
! 1) + 2) theory parameters - for etaile escription see Schieber et al., J. of Rheol. 47(1), 2003 an Khaliullin et al., Phys. Rew. Letters, 2008
! 3) Ensemble size - for G(t) calculation only one chain is permitte
! 4) Transpose of impose velocity graient, kappa. For G(t) calculation these are all zero. Please make sure all components are fitte in one line
! 5) - 8) are switches - to turn on (1) or off (0) various quantities to be followe
! 	5) Constraint ynamics - parameters for p^C(tau^C), they are etermine from an analytic expression, which is vali only for 2 < beta < 50 an 3 < Nk/beta < 80.  Outsie this range, f_ shoul be followe an fit.
!  	6) Relaxation moulus, G(t), calculation.
!	7) Life time istribution of entanglements, f_(t). Necessary for etermining p^C(tau^C).
!	8) etermine iffusion coefficient
! 9) The simulation has fluctuating time step size. This time step etermines how often results are written to files, it cannot be less than one.
! 10) Total simulation time - It is use as a loop parameter, to make sure it oes not run for infinitely long time. It is possible to kill the simulation process at any time an continue from the last save simulation state. 
! 11) Simulation state is store to file every time_save number of time steps
